# ELMTest
This is an attempt to implement a sort of TEA (The ELM Architecture) in Swift. It is not at all final or good, it is just a first draft.

Some people have done better things on the subject like:

- https://github.com/chriseidhof/tea-in-swift
- https://github.com/momentumworks/swift-elm

You can find a very interesting list of different smart attempts here:

There's an interesting part of architecture in the book done by https://objc.io.
